## SoCraTes Soltau 2025

I can finally scratch 'attending the main SoCraTes unconference' from my bucket list.
What can I say - it was worth it!

Although I have visited several great SoCraTes partner events in the past, I've never had the chance to visit the main SoCraTes event.
This year (2025), SoCraTes took place in July for the first time, giving me a chance to attend.
In the past the event was always scheduled in August, which is family vacation time for me.

So whats makes this event special?

### Really diverse

I don't go out much these days, so being confronted with many people enjoying different sexual and clothing choices was new to me.
And what shall I say: It was a pleasure talking to all those "different" (to me!) IT nerds.

There was a really strict Code-of-Conduct.
It took me a while to get used to it.

Jokes/Conversations about things like

- appearance (i.e. fat-shaming),
- drugs (i.e "your cocktail doesn't contain alcohol")
- religion
- or food (making fun of vegans, or people with food intolerance)

...where NOT tolerated.

This was enforced, but easy to follow.

And made conversations always go into a positive direction.
Even when talking about difficult topics such as politics.

### My experience

The acronym SoCraTes stands for "Software Craft and Testing", so these topics where obvious.
Since there were 11 parallel sessions (!) happening there was a lot of FOMO ("fear-of-missing-out") involved.
This FOMO feeling continued for 4 days.
And there where sessions until way past midnight...

I shared some knowledge by giving sessions on:

- Property-Based Testing
- Approval Testing
- Modern Linux CLI Tools

I also visited many other sessions. Some of them where:

- Custom Keyboards
- Test Strategies with QA
- Teaching IT to school kids
- Hating POSIX - Having a look at NuShell

But one of the best sessions was obviously the hallway-track...

And I visited a Pen-Testing evening session.
This turned out to be my absolute highlight.
I visited the follow-up evening session on the next day as well.
If you get a chance to be introduced to Pen-Testing by Lisi: Go for it!

I also learned a lot by Markus Decke on how to moderate a Code-Retreat!

..and last but not least I had the honor to travel with Chris Welcz.
