    <p>I can finally scratch &lsquo;attending the main SoCraTes unconference&rsquo; from my bucket list.
What can I say - it was worth it!</p>
<p>Although I have visited several great SoCraTes partner events in the past, I&rsquo;ve never had the chance to visit the main SoCraTes event in Soltau.
This year SoCraTes Soltau took place in <strong>July</strong> for the first time, giving me a chance to attend
(in the past the event was always scheduled in August, which is family vacation time for me).</p>
<p>So whats makes this event special?</p>
<h3 id="really-diverse">Really diverse</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go out much these days, so being exposed to many people enjoying different sexual and clothing choices was new to me.
And what shall I say: It was a pleasure talking to all those &ldquo;different&rdquo; (to me!) IT nerds.</p>
<p>There was a really strict Code-of-Conduct.
It took me a while to get used to it.</p>
<p>Jokes/Conversations about things like</p>
<ul>
<li>appearance (i.e. fat-shaming),</li>
<li>drugs (i.e &ldquo;your cocktail doesn&rsquo;t contain alcohol&rdquo;)</li>
<li>religion</li>
<li>or food (making fun of vegans, or people with food intolerance)</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;where NOT tolerated.</p>
<p>This was enforced, but easy to follow.</p>
<p>And made <strong>conversations always go into a positive direction.</strong>
Being <strong>tolerant and open-minded goes a long way.</strong>
Even when talking about difficult topics such as politics.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong:
All other SoCraTes partner events I have visited in the past also have enforced the same Code-of-Conduct,
but this event had close to 200 participants, so it was more obvious and necessary.</p>
<h3 id="my-experience">My experience</h3>
<p>The acronym SoCraTes stands for &ldquo;Software Craft and Testing&rdquo;, so these topics where obvious.
Since there were 11 (!) parallel sessions happening at the same time there was a lot of
FOMO (&ldquo;fear-of-missing-out&rdquo;) involved.
This FOMO feeling continued for 4 days.
And there where sessions until way past midnight&hellip;</p>
<p>I shared some knowledge by giving sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-property-based-testing/">Property-Based Testing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-approval-testing/">Approval Testing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://draptik.github.io/2025-07-socrates-de-modern-linux-cli-tools/">Modern Linux CLI Tools</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also visited many other sessions. Some of them where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Keyboards</li>
<li>Test Strategies with QA</li>
<li>Teaching IT to school kids</li>
<li>Hating POSIX - Having a look at NuShell</li>
</ul>
<p>But the best session was obviously the hallway-track ðŸ˜Ž</p>
<p>Aside from a Pen-Testing evening session titled &ldquo;Capture the flag&rdquo;.
This turned out to be my absolute highlight, because the presented test scenario using
<a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">hackthebox.org</a> closely resembled my own freshly setup home-server.
I visited the follow-up evening session on the next day as well.
If you get a chance to be introduced to Pen-Testing by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisihocke/">Lisi</a>: Go for it!</p>
<p>During another evening chat I managed to get one of the smart organizers to fix my home DNS
setup when using WireGuard - took him less than 10min. How cool is that? (thanks <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rradczewski/">Raimo</a>)</p>
<p>On the last day I attended <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-decke/">Markus'</a>
Code-Retreat and learned some new constraints for this popular exercise. &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>My summary: If you have the opportunity to visit this great &ldquo;un-conference&rdquo;: Go for it!</p>
<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>
<p>Traveling to Soltau was challenging, because no matter if you traveled by car or train, there where many obstacles.
I was lucky enough to travel with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-welcz-823603274/">Chris</a>
so the 7 hour trip in each direction was very relaxed.</p>
