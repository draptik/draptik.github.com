My name is Patrick Drechsler. 
I'm a software developer.

In the past I've also spent some time in the field of biomechanics. If you're bored you can look at my thesis on how [insects and frogs cling to surfaces](http://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/2293).

## This blog is...

- ...mainly a place where I write down notes
- ...often a documentation of my trial and error approach to get something up and running
- ...and sometimes a source of knowledge
