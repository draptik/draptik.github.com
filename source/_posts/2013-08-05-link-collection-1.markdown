When I try to learn new technologies I stumble across many sites. 
If a site is useful to the problem at hand, I normally add a comment in my source code referencing the URL.

But if I have the same question again a year (or a week) later, I forgot where I put the URL.
Then I start to go through my browser's bookmarks and history. Then I look through the multitude of 'read-it-later' services, such as [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/), [Evernote](http://evernote.com/), etc. Sometimes I'm lucky and I actually find what I'm looking for. Most of the time I end up repeating the same search procedure again (which is a waste of time).

So here's my first link collection. Themed AngularJS...

- [AngularJS CRUD application demo](https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app): Found this after I created my own demo...

- [Making Maven Grunt](http://addyosmani.com/blog/making-maven-grunt/):
Opinionated advice on using build systems for modern web applications (i.e. Java backend: [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/)) vs. smart frontend ([Bower](http://bower.io/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)). The author describes the different approaches which are possible and gives consise solutions for the non-trivial, but industry-relevant approaches (i.e. invoking Grunt from Maven).

- [Modularized generator for Yeoman angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/109): 
An alternative folder/file structure for AngularJS projects compared to [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). A kickstart project can be found at [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate).
