Half a year ago I introduced an inhouse event called "Lunch and Learn" to the company I work for. I would like to share my today's experiences.

## Motivation

I learn(ed) a lot from visiting local meetups, such as [Softwerkskammer](https://www.softwerkskammer.org/). **Clean Code** is "a thing": I was not the only one who was aware of SOLID, DRY, TDD, etc. But: Not everybody has the time to visit such events in their spare time. So my idea was simple: the people at work can eat lunch, and learn. In their spare time.

## Today...

The company I work for employs hardware and software developers/architects.

Imagine: 12 developers. 3 experienced OO enterprise, 2 hardcore FP, 2 C++, the rest novices, starting a TDD session. Each with different TDD and mob-programming experience.

What I enjoyed most:

- Hearing experts in their field (low-level C programmers discussing with javascript/Haskell cracks with OO-enterprise [c#/java] field-experience people)
- juniors trying to summarize the above

**That moment**: When the C++ guy tried to explain the essence of TDD to the Haskell guy. And everybody pitched in! Another discussion was on it's way!

## Try it: Lunch & Learn

Try it in your company!

Questions: Don't hesitate to contact me!
