My recent discovery: Ubuntu 9.04 comes with [screen-profiles](http://ns2.canonical.com/de/jaunty-updates/screen-profiles), a command-line "GUI" enhancement based on curses. If you have been using GNU-Screen for a while, but have always been too lazy to configure the display (or any other part of the program), you might enjoy this tool.

[Lorna Jane](http://www.lornajane.net/index.php?url=posts/2009/Screen-Profiles-Improved-Screen-in-Ubuntu-Jaunty#feedback) posted a nice summary about screen-profiles.

Side note: This tool was actually developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu.
