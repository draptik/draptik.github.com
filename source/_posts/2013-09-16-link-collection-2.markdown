I attended the [Herbstcampus 2013](http://www.herbstcampus.de/) this month. As usual, a very good conference.

Here is some fun stuff I learned:

- [NancyFx](http://nancyfx.org/) is to [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/) as [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is to [Ruby-on-Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
- [Simple.Data](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data) is a leightweight, convention-based database access abstraction for prototyping
- [SignalR](http://signalr.net/) is cool
