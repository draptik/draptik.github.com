There must be a smarter way to do this... But I'll describe my combersome way anyway. It depends on having windows somewhere.

Old phone: Nokia 6230i

New phone: Samsung S7220

**Goal**: Get all phone contacts from old phone to new phone.

**Solution**:



	
  1. Install Nokia phone software on windows

	
  2. Sync phone content with Outlook-Express (make sure Outlook-Express has an emtpy address book before)

	
  3. Export the address book from Outlook-Express as vcf or wab to a file

	
  4. Install Samsung phone software on windows (does not work with wine)

	
  5. Import address book from vcf/wab

	
  6. Synchronize with new phone using Windows software from Samsung
