If you're developing Rails with [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and using [Rinari](http://rinari.rubyforge.org/) here are two more extensions you might like:

[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/](http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/)

and

[http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/](http://cx4a.org/software/rsense/)

Installation. Just  as described. Code completion for ruby-on-rails with emacs!

And the package is written in Java(!), Very cool!

I am impressed!
