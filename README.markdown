## Notes

Git branch 'source' contains my posts in markdown format. See folder <code>source/_posts/</code>.

When working from different machines, follow [the instructions on this site by Robert Anderson](http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/). Otherwise you might mess up your git repository... Not that this has actually happened to me... ;-)
