# F# and Linux: mixed feelings

I have been trying to learn F# with .NET Core and Linux for some time. My experience so far are mixed. Let me explain what I mean by "mixed":

First off all: It is great that we can use .NET with Linux in the first place! And `dotnet` as CLI-first tool is amazing (not only for linux desktop users, but also for docker, ci)! I can't emphasis this enough!

BUT:

- The templates generated by `dotnet new` are never up-to-date for F#. One always has to spend 30min cleaning up and updating.
- IDE integration (Ionide) also takes weeks until everything works flawlessly after a new dotnet core release (VSCode, Rider).

Example: Currently (2018-11-29) I have to patch `dotnet new xunit -lang f# -o somefolder`:

```sh
$ dotnet new xunit -lang f# -o somefolder
The template "xUnit Test Project" was created successfully.

Processing post-creation actions...
Running 'dotnet restore' on somefolder/somefolder.fsproj...
...
Restore succeeded.
```


```sh
`$ dotnet test
Build started, please wait...
/home/patrick/.nuget/packages/microsoft.net.test.sdk/15.9.0/build/netcoreapp1.0/Microsoft.Net.Test.Sdk.targets(104,5): warning : A 'Program.fs' file can be automatically generated for F# .NET Core test projects. To fix this warning, either delete the file from the project, or set the <GenerateProgramFile> property to 'false'. [/home/patrick/tmp/somefolder/somefolder.fsproj]
...
```

***Why? Learning F#, this really irritates me! Am I doing something wrong? Is it idiomatic to see these kinds of warnings?*** 

Fix:

```sh
cd somefolder
rm Program.fs
sed -i '/Program/d' somefolder.fsproj
```

Simple, isn't it? F#-Team: Talk to the template team.

Electron apps such as VSCode behave unusually with Arch Linux, so I won't comment on that. And Rider is really slow catching up to new .NET Core versions on Linux... (linux: 2nd class citizen).

All in all, F# with .NET Core and Linux: keeps being interesting ;-)

Setup (2018-11-29):

```sh
$ dotnet --info
.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):

Host (useful for support):

.NET Core SDKs installed:

Yes, this is just a rant.

I am still a big fan of F#, .NET Core, and Linux. And the combination of the three. I'll keep trying to understand them, because I think they are a good combination.

Any pointers to better usage are more than welcome!
